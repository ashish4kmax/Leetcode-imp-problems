# Bitwise Operators: Manipulating Binary Numbers
* Bitwise operators are powerful tools for manipulating binary numbers. They operate at the bit level, allowing you to perform various operations efficiently. Here are the most common bitwise operators and their functionalities:
## NOT Operator (~)
* The NOT operator, represented by the tilde (~) symbol, flips the bits of a binary number. It changes each 0 to 1 and each 1 to 0. This operator is useful for inverting the bits of a number.

## AND Operator (&)
* The AND operator, denoted by the ampersand (&) symbol, compares two binary numbers bit by bit. It sets each bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits are also 1. Otherwise, it sets the bit to 0. The AND operator is commonly used for masking and checking the presence of specific bits.

## OR Operator (|)
* The OR operator, represented by the vertical bar (|) symbol, compares two binary numbers bit by bit. It sets each bit to 1 if either of the corresponding bits is 1. If both bits are 0, it sets the resulting bit to 0. The OR operator is useful for combining or merging bits.

## XOR Operator (^)
* The XOR operator, denoted by the caret (^) symbol, compares two binary numbers bit by bit. It sets each bit to 1 if exactly one of the corresponding bits is 1. If both bits are the same (either both 0 or both 1), it sets the resulting bit to 0. The XOR operator is often used for toggling or swapping bits.

## Left Shift Operator (<<)
*The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions. This operation is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount. It is frequently used for efficient multiplication or creating space for additional bits.

## Right Shift Operator (>>)
*The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions. This operation is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 raised to the power of the shift amount. It is commonly used for efficient division or extracting specific bits.

** With these bitwise operators, you can perform complex operations on binary numbers, manipulate individual bits, and optimize certain calculations efficiently.
